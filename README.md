A complete pack with lots of icons from various places in windows 11 as well as other microsoft products.

I have been considering creating individual DLLs when I release v3, LMK if you'd like me to do that

.ICO format, most of these are 256x :)


changelog

v2- removed symbols, added lots of icons from microsoft documentation pages and a few other icons
{i won't be updating until a lot of new ones are released so don't expect a rerelease any time soon}

NOTE: I do not include PNGs or SVGs, don't ask for them. I don't hold onto them so if you want the original images get them yourself lol
(cloudconvert works pretty well for it, except they have a quota)
